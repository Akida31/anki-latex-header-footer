Add-on number 1863928230


Change the LaTeX of every note type.

In my usage, there is no reason to have distinct header, and its a
pain to edit every footer when I realize I do need a package. Hence this simple addon.
I'm too lazy to figure out how to have a multiline text editor, so here it is.

To use:

1) Open the main browser
2) Select "change LaTeX" 
3) Enter the LaTeX header
4) Enter the LaTeX footer
